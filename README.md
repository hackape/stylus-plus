# Stylus Plus
**Handy stylus mixins**

## Quick Start

To use, simplely do `@import "stylus-plus/lib"`. Everything is indexed in reasonable order.

Rather, if you prefer fine control over what to use, import modules as it pleases you. Each module is designed to work independently, but just keep in mind that some of them rely on default variables, e.g., the "border" module.
